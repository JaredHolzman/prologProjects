# prologProjects
Several random small Prolog projects done to learn the language.

To run the each program:
1. install SWI-Prolog 

2. `consult('file.pro').`

3. Run the commented query included at the bottom of each file

##Graph Coloring
The graphColoringMassCounties.pro file colors a Massachusettes map with three color so that no neighbors are the same color. A map of Mass counties has been included in the repo for reference.
